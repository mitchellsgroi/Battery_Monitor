# Battery_Monitor

Use to monitor Voltage, Current and Amp-Hours of a single 12V sealed lead acid battery.
Also includes temperature monitoring for a fridge freezer.

## About

Despite what 4x4 and caravan accessory companies seem to advertise the state of charge (SoC) of lead acid batteries cannot be determined by measuring voltage alone.

I have created this little Arduino based device to measure the amp-hours that have flowed in and out of the battery to give a more accurate representation of the SoC and hopefully help keep the battery from being overly discharged.

A fairly unique feature of this project is that there is no usage of a shunt to measure current. This is instead achieved by a current sensing coil via hall effect. Therefore installation of the device requires very little modification to existing battery systems. 

## Notes

- Currently in the process of cleaning everything up after not having being
  touched in over 3 years.

- There are 3 working prototypes in existence that have been running without
  incident now for about 4 or more years including 1 with the current sensor
  mounted in the engine bay.

- I am not going to provide any usage instructions or license at this stage
  until I sort everything out and package it up properly. 

- Contact me if you have any interest in this project and I will help out where I can.
